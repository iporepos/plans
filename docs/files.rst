Overview
***********************************************************************

The file system in ``plans`` is quite straight-forward.

All files are always formatted in only two ways:

- ``csv`` format for :ref:`Table<io-table>` structure;
- ``tif`` format for :ref:`Raster<io-raster>` (map) structure.

All files fall into three main I/O categories:

#. :ref:`Input Files<io-input-files>`: required and optional data files that users must provide by themselves. Input files lives in the ``data/`` folder of a project.
#. :ref:`Intermediate Files<io-intermediate-files>`: data files generated by ``plans`` as intermediate step to final processing. Users may also provide this files to skip intermediate steps. Like input files, intermediate files lives in the ``data/`` folder of a project;
#. :ref:`Output Files<io-output-files>`: data files generated by ``plans`` as results of final processing. Output files lives under ``outputs/`` in the respective subfolder of the processing session.
